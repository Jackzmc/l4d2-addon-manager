# l4d2-workshop-downloader-ui

A work in progress alternative to my own https://github.com/Jackzmc/l4d2-workshop-downloader that is a combination of rust and Vue.JS via Tauri.

Complete addon management is implemented and is stable.

**Upcoming Features:**

* Enable / Disable Addons
* Better Search (Use steam website directly?)
* Uninstall addon support
* Rename unknown in-app with search for functionality
